= Tractis Identity Verifications

{Tractis Identity Verifications}[https://www.tractis.com/identity_verifications] provide you with a gateway to get your users real identity proven with their electronic certificates.

These custom gateways will request your users a certain set of attributes from their identity such as: name, birthdate, certificate issuer, etc... Your user will have to use an {accepted certificate}[https://www.tractis.com/accepted_certificates] to proof these attributes. Example Given: one website will be able to get his users' real name using Spain or Belgium eID cards.

== How could I use identity verifications in my proyects?

Identity verifications can be public or private. Public verifications give, apart from the user data, a URL to the Proof of Identity Verification for you to link from your website.

You can make two kind of integrations depending on the type of identity verification, pulic or private:

=== Strong authentication
You can use private identity verification gateways as strong authentication gateways in order to provide login with certificates.

=== Certified profiles
Public identity verification gateways allow you to provide certified user profiles in your website where you can highlight those users with certified identity and link the Proof of Identity Verification.

== Installation

  script/plugin install git://github.com/tractis/tractis_identity_verifications.git 

== Get your API-Key

In order to use this plugin you will need to get an API-Key from https://www.tractis.com/identity_verifications

Once you have your API-Key, you will be able to configure which identity attributes you will require and certificates 

== Example usage

Integrating Tractis Identity Verifications requires to:

* Add a form to redirect your users to your gateway.
* Add a controller action to receive the verification data and check it's authenticity.

=== Example view (views/test/index.html.erb)

Use our helper to add the form to redirect your users to your gateway.

  <%= identity_verification_gateway("Identify!", "API-KEY", :action => 'create') %>

=== Example controller (controllers/test_controller.rb)



  class TestController < ApplicationController
    include Tractis::IdentityVerifications
    def create
      valid_tractis_identity_verification!("API-KEY", params)
  
      render :text => <<-TEXT
  <pre>
  Identified
    Name: #{params["tractis:attribute:name"]}
    eID #: #{params["tractis:attribute:dni"]}
    Certificate Issuer: #{params["tractis:attribute:issuer"]}
  </pre>
      TEXT
    rescue Tractis::InvalidVerificationError
      render :text => "Verification failed"
    end
  end

=== Screencast from the demo

You can watch {a technical screencast of this demo}[http://vimeo.com/5508268].

=== Create Certified Profiles in your website

With {Tractis Identity Verifications}[https://www.tractis.com/identity_verifications] you can provide Certified Profiles in your website where Tractis will certify the identity of you user.

In order to create certified profiles you will need to <b>specify that the verification will be public</b> using <b><code>:public_verification => true</code></b>

  <%= identity_verification_gateway("Identify!", "API-KEY", {:action => 'create'}, {:public_verification => true}) %>

The public verification will send an extra parameter called <b><code>:verification_url</code></b> (<code>params[:verification_url]</code>) to the <code>notification_callback</code>. 

This parameter will contain the URL for the Identity Verification Proof. You will be able to link this Proof only within your website to let your users check verified identity.
